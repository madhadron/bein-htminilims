* Access control
** TODO Set up apache and a cherrypy or something running on another port in vmware
** TODO Make apache proxy to other port
** TODO Set up htaccess for apache on other port
** TODO Set up forwarding to 80 and other port via VMWare so I can access it from outside
** TODO Set up iptables rules on VMWare side to prevent access to other port, but still allow proxied access with password

* New path scheme
/ --> /executions
/executions[?page=...]  (Shows 10 entries per page most recent first)
/files[?page=...]       ("")
/executions/12          (Retrieves HTML for execution 12 to insert in page)
/executions/12/detail   (Retrieves HTML for details of 12 to insert in page)
/executions/12/log      (Retrieves HTML of external program logs to insert in page)
/files/12/detail (Same idea)

* TODO Move file display into a function, embed in Mako template
* TODO Rewrite execution display as a template using new format (no ajax)
* TODO Rewrite file display as a template using new format (no ajax)
* TODO Add file details and execution details/log hide/show
